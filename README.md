# Trading-Algorithm
This project implements a backtesting strategy based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The strategy opens long positions when the RSI falls below 30 (oversold condition) and short positions when the RSI rises above 70 (overbought condition). The Average True Range (ATR) indicator sets the stop-loss and take-profit levels.
